## Recently Completed

### Foundation through current SaaS state
Full pipeline is now in place across the repo: multi-tenant DB, background scheduler, operator dashboard, email validation, analytics, CSV import, SendGrid routing, reply classification, deliverability hardening, Find-and-Fire polling/UI, client prospects flow, SendGrid webhook security, and per-client sender identity.

### Current shipped client/product layer

**Public/product flow:**
- `/` = landing page
- `/checkout` = pricing / pilot checkout page
- `/onboard` = self-serve signup
- `/client/login` -> `/client/verify` -> `/client` = magic-link client dashboard
- `/ops` = internal operator dashboard

**Client-facing features:**
- `GET/POST /client/settings` - clients can update niche, ICP, location, booking link, sender name, and sender email
- `GET /client/prospects` - client-scoped prospects list with search/filter/sort/pagination
- `GET /client/prospects/export` - filtered CSV export
- `GET /client/prospects/<id>` - client prospect detail page
- `POST /client/prospects/bulk-action` - bulk enrol and bulk status updates for client-owned prospects
- `POST /client/reply-drafts/<id>/action` - client-gated approve/dismiss
- prospect detail page now supports in-place reply draft approve/dismiss for pending drafts

**Operator/internal features:**
- `/ops` accepts `client_id` and scopes dashboard data to a selected workspace
- operator AJAX refreshes keep the selected `client_id`
- operator actions respect selected workspace across outreach queue, reply queue, send-outreach, enrol, patch, and delete actions
- Find-and-Fire `/ops` UI now uses enriched polling state and renders incremental result cards with stage badges

**Deliverability / email features:**
- `deliverability.py` is the shared outbound decision layer
- SMTP-first outcome mapping is live
- SendGrid bounce/drop/unsubscribe webhook handling is live at `/webhook/sendgrid`
- SendGrid signed event verification is supported via `SENDGRID_WEBHOOK_PUBLIC_KEY`
- per-client sender identity is persisted and used during outbound sends

---

## Active Constraints

- `LINKEDIN_DRY_RUN=true` by default
- All sends in `web_app.py` must go through `_route_send_email()`
- Client reply draft actions check `draft.client_id == session.client_id` and return 404 on mismatch
- Scheduler can be disabled with `--no-scheduler` or `SCHEDULER_ENABLED=false`
- `/settings` is Basic Auth protected
- `/` is public marketing and `/ops` is internal operator UI
- `/client` requires `session["client_id"]`
- House account is always `client_id=1`
- Find-and-Fire uses job-id polling, not SSE
- `get_prospect_by_id()` must be used to reload a prospect after research
- SendGrid now supports attachments and thread headers
- SendGrid signed webhook verification is optional and only enforced when `SENDGRID_WEBHOOK_PUBLIC_KEY` is set
- Client sender identity is stored per workspace and used during outbound sends, but mailbox/domain verification UX is still missing

## Next Session - Planned Tasks

1. Pre-first-client hardening later: sender verification visibility, onboarding sanity pass, deployment cleanup, docs/runbook cleanup
2. Mailbox/domain verification workflow per client
3. More `/ops` polish and deeper workspace drilldowns
4. Production deploy hardening and env cleanup
